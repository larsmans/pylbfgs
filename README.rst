This is a Python wrapper around Naoaki Okazaki (chokkan)'s liblbfgs_ library
of quasi-Newton optimization routines (limited memory BFGS and OWL-QN).

This package aims to provide a cleaner interface to the LBFGS
algorithm than is currently available in SciPy_, and to provide the
OWL-QN algorithm to Python users.


Installing
==========
Type::

    pip install pylbfgs


Hacking
=======
Type::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cython lbfgs/_lowlevel.pyx
    python setup.py build_ext -i

to build PyLBFGS in-place, i.e. without installing it.

To run the test suite, make sure you have pytest_ installed, and type::

    pytest tests
